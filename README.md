# MediKart-Online-Medicine-E-Commerce-Platform
<br>
We are students of Code IT, Prithvi Path, Dharan, currently enrolled in the MERN Stack Web Development Course. As part of our practical learning and group assignment, we have initiated the development of a Medicine E-Commerce Website. This project aims to enhance our hands-on experience in full-stack development using modern technologies like MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, and Next.js. It serves as both a learning exercise and a demonstration of our collaborative development skills.
